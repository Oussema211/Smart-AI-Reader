Water Meter Consumption Reader Web Application
This web application uses artificial intelligence (AI) to read water meter consumptions from a selection of images.
It employs a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately recognize and extract consumption values from
the water meter images.
if you want to install it try : 
git clone https://github.com/Oussema211/Smart-AI-Reader.git
The AI model used by the web application was trained on a diverse dataset of water meter images with corresponding consumption values. 
The dataset is Toloka WaterMeter
